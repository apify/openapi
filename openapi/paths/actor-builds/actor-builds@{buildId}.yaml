  summary: Get build
  description: >-
    Gets an object that contains all the details about a specific build of an
    Actor.

    By passing the optional `waitForFinish` parameter the API endpoint will
    synchronously wait for the build to finish. This is useful to avoid periodic 
    polling when waiting for an Actor build to finish.

    This endpoint does not require the authentication token. The calls are
    authenticated using a hard-to-guess ID of the build.
  operationId: getBuild
  parameters:
    - name: buildId
      in: path
      description: 'ID of the build you want to get, found in the build''s `Info` tab.'

    - name: waitForFinish
      in: query
      description: >-
        The maximum number of seconds the server waits for the build to finish.
        By default it is `0`, the maximum value is `60`. 
        
        <!-- MAX_ACTOR_JOB_ASYNC_WAIT_SECS -->
        
        If the build finishes in time then the returned build object will have a 
        terminal status (e.g. `SUCCEEDED`), otherwise it will have a transitional status (e.g. `RUNNING`).
