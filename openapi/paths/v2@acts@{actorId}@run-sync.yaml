  summary: With input
  description: >-
    Runs a specific actor and returns its output.


    The POST payload including its `Content-Type` header is passed as `INPUT` to
    the actor (usually <code>application/json</code>).

    The HTTP response contains actor's `OUTPUT` record from its default
    key-value store.


    The actor is started with the default options; you can override them using
    various URL query parameters.

    If the actor run exceeds 300<!-- MAX_ACTOR_JOB_SYNC_WAIT_SECS --> seconds,

    the HTTP response will have status 408 (Request Timeout).


    Beware that it might be impossible to maintain an idle HTTP connection for a
    long period of time,

    due to client timeout or network conditions. Make sure your HTTP client is
    configured to have a long enough connection timeout.

    If the connection breaks, you will not receive any information about the run
    and its status.


    To run the actor asynchronously, use the [Run
    actor](#reference/actors/run-collection/run-actor) API endpoint instead.
