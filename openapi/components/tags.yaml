- name: Actors
  description: >-
    The API endpoints described in this section enable you to manage, build
    and run Apify actors.

    For more information, see the <a
    href="https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors">Actor documentation</a>.


    Note that for all the API endpoints that accept the `actorId` parameter to
    specify an actor,

    you can pass either the actor ID (e.g. `HG7ML7M8z78YcAPEB`) or a
    tilde-separated

    username of the actor owner and the actor name (e.g. `janedoe~my-actor`).


    Some of the API endpoints return runs objects. Note that if any such run
    object contains usage in dollars, your effective unit pricing at the time
    of query

    has been used for computation of this dollar equivalent, and hence it
    should be used only for informative purposes. You can learn more

    about platform usage in the <a
    href="https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/running/usage-and-resources#usage">documentation</a>.
- name: Actor tasks
  description: >-
    The API endpoints described in this section enable you to manage and run
    Apify actor tasks.

    For more information, see the <a
    href="https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/running/tasks">Actor tasks
    documentation</a>.


    Note that for all the API endpoints that accept the `actorTaskId`
    parameter to specify a task,

    you can pass either the task ID (e.g. `HG7ML7M8z78YcAPEB`) or a
    tilde-separated

    username of the task's owner and the task's name (e.g. `janedoe~my-task`).


    Some of the API endpoints return runs objects. Note that if any such run
    object contains usage in dollars, your effective unit pricing at the time

- name: Actor runs
  description: >-
    The API endpoints described in this section enable you to manage Apify
    actor runs.


    Note that if any returned run object contains usage in dollars, your
    effective unit pricing at the time of query

    has been used for computation of this dollar equivalent, and hence it
    should be used only for informative purposes.

- name: Actor builds
  description: >-
    The API endpoints described in this section enable you to manage Apify
    actor builds.


    Note that if any returned build object contains usage in dollars, your
    effective unit pricing at the time of query

    has been used for computation of this dollar equivalent, and hence it
    should be used only for informative purposes.

- name: Key-value stores
  description: >-
    This section describes API endpoints to manage Key-value stores.

    Key-value store is a simple storage for saving and reading data records or
    files.

    Each data record is represented by a unique key and associated with a MIME
    content type.

    Key-value stores are ideal for saving screenshots, actor inputs and
    outputs, web pages,

    PDFs or to persist the state of crawlers.

    For more information, see the <a
    href="https://docs.apify.com/platform/storage/key-value-store">Key-value
    store documentation</a>.


    Note that some of the endpoints do not require the authentication token,
    the calls

    are authenticated using a hard-to-guess ID of the key-value store.
- name: Datasets
  description: >-
    This section describes API endpoints to manage Datasets.


    Dataset is a storage for structured data, where each record stored has the
    same attributes,

    such as online store products or real estate offers. You can imagine it as
    a table,

    where each object is a row and its attributes are columns. Dataset is an
    append-only

    storage - you can only add new records to it but you cannot modify or
    remove existing

    records. Typically it is used to store crawling results.

    For more information, see the <a
    href="https://docs.apify.com/platform/storage/dataset">Datasets
    documentation</a>.


    Note that some of the endpoints do not require the authentication token,
    the calls

    are authenticated using the hard-to-guess ID of the dataset.
- name: Request queues
  description: >-
    This section describes API endpoints to manage request queues.

    Request queue is a storage for a queue of HTTP URLs to crawl, which is
    typically used for deep crawling of websites where you

    start with several URLs and then recursively follow links to other pages.

    The storage supports both breadth-first and depth-first crawling orders.

    For more information, see the <a
    href="https://docs.apify.com/platform/storage/request-queue">Request queue
    documentation</a>.


    Note that some of the endpoints do not require the authentication token,
    the calls

    are authenticated using the hard-to-guess ID of the queue.
- name: Webhooks
  description: >-
    This section describes API endpoints to manage webhooks.


    Webhooks provide an easy and reliable way to configure the Apify platform

    to carry out an action (e.g. a HTTP request to another service) when a
    certain system event occurs.

    For example, you can use webhooks to start another actor when an actor run
    finishes or fails.

    For more information see <a
    href="https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/webhooks">Webhooks
    documentation</a>.
- name: Webhook dispatches
  description: This section describes API endpoints to get webhook dispatches.
- name: Schedules
  description: >-
    This section describes API endpoints for managing schedules.


    Schedules are used to automatically start your actors at certain times.
    Each schedule can be associated with a number of actors and actor tasks.
    It is also possible

    to override the settings of each actor (task) similarly to when invoking
    the actor (task) using the API.

    For more information, see <a
    href="https://docs.apify.com/platform/schedules">Schedules
    documentation</a>.


    Each schedule is assigned actions for it to perform. Actions can be of two
    types - `RUN_ACTOR` and `RUN_ACTOR_TASK`. For details, see the
    documentation of the

    [Get schedule](#reference/schedules/schedule-object/get-schedule)
    endpoint.
- name: Store
  description: >-
    [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store) is home to hundreds of public
    Actors available to the Apify community.

    The API endpoints described in this section are used to retrieve these
    Actors.


    Note that the endpoints do not require the authentication token.
- name: Logs
  description: >-
    The API endpoints described in this section are used the download the logs

    generated by actor builds and runs. Note that only the trailing 5M
    characters

    of the log are stored, the rest is discarded.


    Note that the endpoints do not require the authentication token, the calls

    are authenticated using a hard-to-guess ID of the actor build or run.
- name: Users
  description: >-
    The API endpoints described in this section return information about user
    accounts.
